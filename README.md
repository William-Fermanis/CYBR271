Buffer Overflow Exploit Implementation Code

# How to Use

This repository contains simple buffer overflow exploit examples targeting a vulnerable program that reads input from a file called badfile.
Each script (exploit.py, exploitL2.py, exploitL3.py) generates a malicious badfile payload designed for different environments (32-bit vs 64-bit).

Disclaimer: These files are for educational purposes only (e.g., studying computer security, buffer overflows, and exploit development). Do not use them on systems you do not own or have permission to test.
